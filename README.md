# Smart-traffic-signal

In this project, we developed a smart traffic light system that utilizes cameras to monitor each lane and count the number of vehicles. The system then optimizes the traffic light timings in real-time based on the vehicle count, effectively reducing congestion and improving traffic flow efficiency.
